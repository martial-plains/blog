Hey there! I'm **Allister Isaiah Harvey** — a developer and music enthusiast who loves blending **code** and **creativity**. I spend my days building digital solutions and my free time exploring my passion for **music**, creating new tracks, and sharing them online.

This blog is a mix of everything I’m passionate about—**coding**, **music**, and the **creative process**. Here, you’ll find a combination of development insights, personal reflections, and the occasional update on my latest music releases.

I hope this space inspires you, whether you're into programming, music, or both! Thanks for stopping by.
